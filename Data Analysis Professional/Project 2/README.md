## Medical_appointments_no-show-dataset

#### Introduction
##### This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The main qeustion we are trying to answer here is why 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointment. We are trying to predict the most important factors that affect the atendance of the patient.

**Some questions we can ask to help us explore the data:**

- Does the patient gender has a realation with the atendance?
- Does the neighborhood play a role in making patients don't show up? "Location of the hospital"
- Which pateints show up more? Does old age take care of their health more than youth?
- Does the disease type affect the patient's show up?
